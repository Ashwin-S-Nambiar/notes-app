# 🗒️ Notes App

***A full-stack app made with the help of Next.js. Made in order to better understand Next.js and full-stack with it too. Also uses PocketBase for holding the data. More improvements are on the way.***

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js - For building the app.**
- **TailwindCSS - For theming and styling purposes.**
- **[PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) - For API call / backend.**

## ✨ Installation / Running

1. **Clone the repo to your PC.**
2. **Run `npm i && npm run dev` in the terminal to install the dependencies and to run the app.**
3. **Go to [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) and download the `pocketbase.exe` file for your operating system.**
4. **After adding the `pocketbase.exe` file to your root folder in your ptoject, run `./pocketbase serve`.**
5. **This will run the server and ask you to create a new collection and to create records accordingly. The API point will be at `http://localhost/api/` to access the data.**
6. **Congrats!!, you have completed the intialization for the app and can continue with the changes you intend to do.**
